Everyone wants to customize their desktop with an awesome wallpaper. I this repository I just try to add some mindblowing images that I like the most.
These are the best hand picked wallpapers from different sources.

## Source Of These Wallpapers
-> unsplash
-> pixabay
-> some linux distributions
-> etc.

## Type Of Wallpapers
There are different types of wallpapers. Natural and abstract wallpapers are my favorite choices. Remember one thing, if you set dark theme in your machine then you will need white background image.
And If you set light theme in your machine, then you will need black background.

## OWNERSHIP
As I download these images from different websites, I don't know anything about their copyright stuff. So, if the image in this directory belongs to you, then please contact me, I will definitely delete that image.

Have a nice day!!!
